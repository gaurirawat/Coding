This was a question on String that I donâ€™t remember.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-arrays-set-2-different-sized-arrays/, there was a slight difference though. If there are k arrays, the last array had n elements but the total size of this array was equal to the sum of sizes of all the other arrays and n. I was not allowed to use any extra space. To solve this question, I had to use a max heap of size k from the end of and the result was inserted at the end of the last array each time.
Difference between ipv4 and ipv6 except for the length.

Given a space separated string find the first substring whose reverse is present in the string. And string will end with $ sign.
Chocolate distribution problem-There are N people standing in a row with some count (1<=i<=N) number of chocolates in their hands. You have to select a range of people and take all their chocolates with the condition that you should be able to distribute those chocolates equally among M boxes. Write a program to determine the maximum number of chocolates that can be placed in a box.
