1. Merge two arrays to sorted form.
2. Slight variation of activity selection problem.

4. There are n soldiers account and m donation. you need to put each donation in the soldier's account which has the least balance.
5. here are 2 packaging machines and each machine takes n steps to pack an order. Cost of each step is given and cost to shift from step i from one machine to step i+1 of another machine is also given. Find minimum cost to pack the order.
6. Array of cost given. You can start from 0 or 1 index and jump to the next or next+1 index. you need to traverse the complete array using minimum cost. Each index has cost you need to add it if you take that index;

9. First two questions were similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles
10. A simple problem, could be solved using warshall’s algorithm or simple dfs, finding the node with longest dfs in a directed graph.
11. Given two circles with their centres co-ordinates and their radii , we need to find the non overlapping area between the circles. But the catch here was people didn’t know the function for cos inverse, sine inverse
CPP
Refer : inverse trigonometric functions in cpp ...its asin(), I guess
12. Given  a 2D matrix of 1s(bright areas) and 0s(dark area, and s) N = Number of dark areas to be removed is given.
Now, we had to find the least zeros left after converting the least N dark connected areas in the matrix.
Ans : Connected Components of the graphs concept
14. Find the minimum of product all the paths from the tree to leaves. (question was not this)
Ans:If we construct the tree, it takes time. So, just maintain an array of parents and perform this multiplication.
