NP PROBLEMS

In computational complexity theory, a problem is NP-complete when:
1. A nondeterministic Turing machine can solve it in polynomial-time.
2. A deterministic Turing machine can solve it in large time complexity classes(e.g., EXPTIME and can verify its
solutions in polynomial time. It can be used to simulate any other problem with similar solvability.

A problem is called NP (nondeterministic polynomial) if its solution can be guessed and verified in polynomial time;
More precisely, each input to the problem should be associated with a set of solutions of polynomial length, whose
validity can be tested quickly (in polynomial time),such that the output for any input is "yes" if the solution set is
non-empty and "no" if it is empty. The complexity class of problems of this form is called NP, an abbreviation for
"nondeterministic polynomial time".

A problem is said to be NP-hard if everything in NP can be transformed in polynomial time into it even though it may not
be in NP.
Conversely, a problem is NP-complete if it is both in NP and NP-hard. The NP-complete problems represent the hardest
problems in NP. If any NP-complete problem has a polynomial time algorithm, all problems in NP do. The set of
NP-complete problems is often denoted by NP-C or NPC.Thus, finding an efficient algorithm for any NP-complete problem
implies that an efficient algorithm can be found for all such problems, since any problem belonging to this class can be
recast into any other member of the class.

NP-complete problem are a class of computational problems for which no efficient solution algorithm has been found. Many
significant computer-science problems belong to this class—e.g., the traveling salesman problem, satisfiability problems,
and graph-covering problems.

Travelling salesman problem:, NP-hard
for n nodes, find a hamiltonian cycle with minimum weight. O(n^n);

0/1 Knapsack: NP-Complete
Here the complexity is O(n*w) where w=total weight and n is the no of element.
This looks like a polynomial time, but it is not, it is pseudo-polynomial.
Time complexity measures the time that an algorithm takes as a function of the length in bits of its input. The dynamic
programming solution is indeed linear in the value of W, but exponential in the length of W. The value of W grows
exponentially with x, thus the algorithm is not really polynomial, it's exponential (but it looks like it is polynomial,
hence the name: "pseudo-polynomial").

Min Vertex Cover
In a given undirected graph, what is the (size of the) smallest subset of the vertices covering all of the edges?

NP complete problems:

Max Independent Set: In a given undirected graph, what is the (size of the) larges subset of the vertices having no
 edges in common?
Max Clique: What is the (size of the) largest complete subgraph of a given undirected graph?
Min Set Cover: Given a set S and a collection of subsets of S, what is smallest set of these subsets whose union is S?
Min Hitting Set: Given a set S and a collection of subsets of S, what is smallest subset of S containing at least one
 element from every subset?
Hamilton Path, Hamilton Cycle
Longest Path: What is the longest path between two given nodes in a weighted, undirected, graph?
Subset Sum: Does a given set of positive integers have a subset with sum k?
Partition: Can a given set of positive integers be partitioned into two subsets each with the same sum?
3-Partition: Can a given set of 3n positive integers be partitioned into n 3-element subsets each with the same sum?
Minesweeper: In a given Minesweeper configuration, is it safe to click on a particular square?
Sodoku: Does a given Sodoku puzzle have a solution?

-HAMILTONIAN CYCLE: np hard problem
-GRAPH ISOMORPHISM: given two graphs we need to identify if they are same or not. It not known to be solvable in
polynomial time nor to be NP-complete, and therefore may be in the computational complexity class NP-intermediate.
-Web crawler: prefer BFS over DFS because DFS takes us very far from the starting vertex while BFS takes us away slowly
and generally we may want to discover just the close vertices.

Trie_lc_word_search_2
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/submissions/

m rows, n columns, l=no of words, wl= max length of each words (here it is given as 10)
TC=O(m * n * 4^wl). m*n for "for-loop" and 4 for each adjacent cell. since wl=max length of each word TC of
isWordPossible function becomes 4^wl.
SC=O(l*wl).  Other than this stack space will also be used which is equal to the max depth of our trie and here that
will be 10 since our max length of each word is given as 10

space is O(L) and time is O(M * N * 4^L)
N = row length
M = col length
L = word length

TC=O(n^2*l) where n=no of words in wordList. length of the words.
SC=O(n^2)

LL_lc_sortList
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/solution/

TC=O(nlogn) since we are implementing merge sort.
sc=O(1). but stack space is O(n) since we are recursively using merge function which will be o(n).

Heap_lc_top_k_frequent_items
https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/

TC= O(xlogx) where x=no of unique elements. It will never be = nlogn even if all elements are unique since then we will
return the actual array using our if condition. hence xlogx<nlogn.
SC=O(x+k(for the pq)+k(for the ans) )= O(x)

Array_lc_count_of_range_sum_merge_sort
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/submissions/

TC= O(nlogn). CountFunc is calling merge function logn times and itself 2*logn times.
    The complexity of merge function is O(n) since we iterate from l->mid. For every element the inner while loops also
    run but they run a total of mid->n ie o(n). This means that if we consider every outer loop and add the no of times
    the inner loop runs then that would be a total of just n/2 ie O(n).
    so complexity for merge function becomes. O(n+n)=O(n).
SC= O(n) create dummy array at the time of merging.
