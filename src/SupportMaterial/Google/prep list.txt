Operating Systems, Systems Programming and Concurrency:
○ Know about processes, threads, and concurrency issues. Know about locks, mutexes, semaphores and monitors, and how
they work. Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them.
○ Know what resources a processes needs, a thread needs, how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the
operating system and underlying hardware.
○ Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of "modern"
concurrency constructs.
